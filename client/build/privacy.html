                            differing uses. We will post the revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be
                            aware of what information we collect, how the information is used and under what
                            circumstances such information may be disclosed. You agree to review the Policy periodically
                            so that you are aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Site indicates your
